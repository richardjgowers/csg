      <DESC>boolean variable: false - simple least squares, true - constrained least squares. For details see the VOTCA paper. Practically, both algorithms give the same results, but simple least squares is faster. If you are a mathematician and you think that a spline can only then be called a spline if it has continuous first and second derivatives, use constrained least squares.</DESC>

Atomistic trajectory, specified with --trj option, is divided into blocks and the force matching equations are solved separately for each block.

       <DESC>Minimum value of the potential function range.  This value can not be too small, it can result in ill-conditioned system due to poor sampling of the repulsive core. One can get this number by looking at the distribution function for this interaction. For non-bonded interactions it is the distance to the rdf start.  For cbspl form,  knot values corresponding to the distances smaller than this paramter are extrapolated and too large min value may result in negative knot values in the repulsive core region due to attractive potential/force near the large min distance. </DESC>
