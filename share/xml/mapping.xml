  <cg_bonded>
    <desc>The cg_bonded section contains all bonded interaction of the molecule. Those can be bond, angle or dihedral. An entry for each group of bonded interaction can be specified, e.g. several groups (types) of bonds can be specified. A specific bonded interaction can be later on addressed by MOLECULE:NAME:NUMBER, where MOLECULE is the molecule ID in the whole topology, NAME the name of the interaction group and NUMBER addresses the interaction in the group.</desc>
